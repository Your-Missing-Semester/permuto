## About the project
Permuto is a community-driven marketplace app designed to help people exchange skills and services without monetary transactions.

The app provides a platform where users can exchange their expertise, fostering a collaborative community of lifelong learners.

For example, a guitarist can offer lessons to a chef who wants to pick up guitar in their free time.

In return, the chef can offer cooking lessons to help the guitarist improve their culinary skills.

This creates a mutually rewarding exchange of knowledge and skills, all without the need for financial transactions.
